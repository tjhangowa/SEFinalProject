## Status: Project In Development 

## ☣️ The Outbreak: Project Overview

- INFECTION X is a fast-paced, free-for-all multiplayer survival game developed as a final project for our Software Engineering course. Set in a desolate urban environment, the game uses a dynamic, real-time infection mechanic to pit four players against each other.

- The core premise is simple: Survival is a race against the clock and the contagion.

## 📝 Game Objective
- The Infected: One player starts as the Infected. Their sole mission is to tag and infect every other survivor before the timer runs out.
- The Survivors: Three players start as Survivors. They must evade the Infected until the designated {XX:XX} time limit expires. 


## 🏆 Win Conditions 🏆
1. If all players become Infected before the timer hits zero, The Infected Win.
2. If the timer runs out with any Survivor remaining healthy, The Survivors Win.

### 1) In a tag/infection game, what would you describe your ideal match length to be?
- 5-8 minutes probably
- 10 minutes max
- 5-7 mins fast and not too long because to keep them excited throughout the game. Can’t be too short and too long, because then it’ll be boring.
- 5-10 minutes

### 2) Assume there will be powerups in this game. What powerups sound interesting to you? 
- A speed boost of some kind or instead of a speed boost maybe a teleport/blink
- Some form of camoflauge possibly, allowing an infected or tagged person to sneak up on somebody uninfected
- Quick dash
- Speed boost
- A cure power up to cure the infected into normal
- Speed boosts, invisibility, traps, clones, stuns, teleports, knockbacks

### 3) In any type of infection type of game or game mode where there's non-infected and infected what is the most common annoying thing that occurs in these type of games for you?
- Infected players camping spawn areas
- Trolling or throwing matches or griefing, for example infected not going for the uninfected
- Bad hitbox, killer being too fast, bad map pool(balanced map pool)
- Map size either too big or too small
- Nothing happening for too long, or too many things happening at once, as well as dead ends

### 4) Whats something unique regarding an infected game or game mode that made it really fun for you? 
- Game where the infected ramped up, such as they get stronger over time, maybe faster
- If the map changed somehow during the game, to make it interesting (fortnite-like maybe with a storm) or just having hallways that can open/close
- Outplaying the infected, like a skill type play
- Depends, if the gameplay is too straight forward, it would not be fun. You need depth like having skills that are not too broken and have the ability to outplay the infected, something like to counter or something. Nothing too broken on  either side.
Because it would be fast paced, quick games.
- Being able to cure the infected, or not knowing who is infected. Competition for resources also can be fun



### 5)  Would an “infection mode” be fun? Why / why not?
  #### Which version sounds better:
  #### Team vs Team (Infected vs Healthy), or
  #### Free-for-all where tagging converts players?
- Free-for-all where tagging converts players
- Team vs Team but it's easier for free for all
- They all said it’s gonna be an infected side because the skill is not balanced.
- They all said free for all because survivors has a chance and it’s pretty balanced between the infected and the runners.
- Free for all sounds better than team vs team as it would be much more complex and difficult to learn
